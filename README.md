<i> StrEmbed-5-2 is a graphical user interface for visualisation and manipulation of part-whole relationships in assemblies of parts. It is written in Python and uses the modules listed in the "requirements" document. Functionality is based on [StrEmbed-4](https://github.com/hhchau/StrEmbed-4) (and earlier versions) by Hau Hing Chau, written in Perl.</i>  

<b>This research is supported by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) under grant number EP/S016406/1.</b>

Two scripts are required:
1. StrEmbed_5_2
2. step_parse_5_2

It is recommended that you download the entire folder. STEP files are used for data transfer and several examples are provided in the 'Examples / Models' folder. In addition, for the torch example, part images are given in the 'Images' folder, where image names correspond to their product definitions in the STEP file; they are currently pre-rendered but will be generated automatically in the next version.

StrEmbed-5-2 was developed in Spyder, an IDE for packaged with the Anaconda distribution, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/).

A users' manual is provided, and tutorials are available via Google Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com).

StrEmbed-5-2 is published under the GNU General Purpose License version 3, which is given in the LICENSE document.
